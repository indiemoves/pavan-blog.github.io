In the last few weeks, about 4 people I know, and me, have bought noise-cancellation headphones. They have spent a good amount of money to buy these. For me it made sense, because I do listen to a lot of music and podcasts, but these guys are into neither. They put them on without any music because this is one thing that helps them focus in an open office culture. Amusing, but a valid use case if you ask me. Put them on and world feels like a better place, I can vouch. Be careful tho, do not use while you're walking on a busy street.
