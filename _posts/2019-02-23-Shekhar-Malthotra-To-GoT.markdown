Guys I don't want to be controversial here but Shekhar Malhotra was a great guy. He trained hard, dated girls, won championships and had backed his friends. Unlike Sanju who was lazy, used his friends to his advantage and was jealous and insecure.
Shekhar seems like a guy I could hangout with, and Sanju, for whom I rooted as a kid, not so much. We change.

Now let me sleep early on Sunday so I can wake up early on Monday and start my day with blood, gore, deceit and sex. I used to watch cartoons for breakfast.

`Disclaimer: I have only watched Season 1 of GoT, but you get the point.`
