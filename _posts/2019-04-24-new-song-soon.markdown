So here's the thing: we were to release a new song in April. Due to some technical delays, we have had to delay the release by a month. Having said that, good thing has been that we have been able to spend more time thinking about the song and been able to make changes. We're done working on the song as I post this, now we have to work on the release formalities.

If you want to be among the first ones to listen to the song, join the mailing list [here](https://mailchi.mp/50f717a4c30a/pavanmailinglist) .

If you have any ideas, you can always DM me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/pavan.music).
I am a sucker for ideas.
