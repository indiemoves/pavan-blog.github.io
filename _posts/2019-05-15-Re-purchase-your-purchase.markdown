Since we are renting everything nowadays, convenience included, it is a good time to highlight the fact that we own the channels, not the content.
I own my Kindle, not the ebooks. I own my cellphone, not the music I listen to. I have subscription to Netflix, Amazon Prime and even Hot Star (don't ask), but I still cannot watch "Manhattan". I have to purchase that separately.
I am considering going back to buying DVDs. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Let's consider ownership.

`We do realize that one day Amazon can just say, "hey, about the ebooks you bought, your lease contract has expired and you need to re-purchase them or we'll delete them from your library", right?
Yes?
OK.`
