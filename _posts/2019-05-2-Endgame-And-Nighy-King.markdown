I was really hoping they would lure Thanos into an alternate future timeline and then press a button and come back to the present present in the Avengers HQ and then press one more button and kill that timeline, trapping Thanos forver.

`Night king scene, which I happened to watch in passing reminded me of the Scorpion King scene`
